ABOUT:
This program uses open cv to detect a particular color and then replace it with the background, giving an invisiblity effect.

HOW TO USE:
1.The program first takes a snapshot of the background so.. come in front of the camera, couple of seconds after the program is executed.
2.It detects blue color so the color of the cloth u want to use as your cloak should be blue.
